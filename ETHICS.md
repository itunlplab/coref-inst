# Ethics and Data Usage Statement

## Dataset Usage

This code is designed to work with the CorefUD dataset and other publicly available coreference resolution datasets. Please ensure you comply with the following:

### CorefUD Dataset
- **License**: Check the specific license for each language in the CorefUD dataset
- **Attribution**: Properly cite the CorefUD dataset and individual treebank contributors
- **Usage**: Follow the terms of use specified by the Universal Dependencies and CorefUD projects

### Other Datasets
When using this code with other datasets:
- Ensure you have proper licenses and permissions
- Respect any restrictions on commercial use or redistribution
- Cite the original dataset creators appropriately

## Model Usage

### Pre-trained Models
This code uses various pre-trained language models:
- **Llama**: Follow Meta's usage policies and licenses
- **Gemma**: Follow Google's usage policies and licenses  
- **Mistral**: Follow Mistral AI's usage policies and licenses

### Fine-tuned Models
- Models fine-tuned using this code inherit the license constraints of the base models
- Consider the ethical implications of your specific use case
- Be transparent about model limitations and potential biases

## Research Ethics

### Reproducibility
- All experiments should be reproducible using the provided configuration system
- Report random seeds and other relevant parameters
- Make code and configurations available for peer review

### Bias and Fairness
- Coreference resolution models may exhibit biases present in training data
- Test your models across different demographic groups and languages
- Report any observed biases or limitations in your publications

### Environmental Impact
- Large language model training has environmental costs
- Consider using existing checkpoints when possible
- Report computational resources used in your experiments

## Publication Guidelines

### Code Attribution
- Cite this software appropriately in your publications
- Include version numbers and specific configurations used
- Make your experimental setup reproducible

### Data Attribution  
- Cite all datasets used in your experiments
- Follow each dataset's specific citation requirements
- Acknowledge data creators and annotators

### Transparency
- Report model performance across different groups and languages
- Discuss limitations and potential negative societal impacts
- Include error analysis and failure cases
